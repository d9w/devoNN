# Overview

In nature, brains are built through a process of biological development in which
many aspects of the network of neurons and connections change are shaped by
external information received through sensory organs. Biological development
mechanisms such as axon guidance and dendrite pruning have been shown to rely on
neural activity. Despite this, most artificial neural network (ANN) models do
not include developmental mechanisms and regard learning as the adjustment of
connection weights, while some that do use development restrain it to a period
before the ANN is used. It is worthwhile to understand the cognitive functions
offered by development and to investigate the fundamental questions raised by
artificial neural development. In this workshop, we will explore existing and
future approaches that aim to incorporate development into ANNs. Invited
speakers will present their work with neural networks, both artificial and
biological, in the context of development. Accepted submissions on contemporary
work in this field will be presented and we will hold an open discussion on the
topic.

# [2020 Workshop](/devonn/2020/07/13/alife.html)

The 3rd edition of the Developmental Neural Networks Workshop will be held as a
