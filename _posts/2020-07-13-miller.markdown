Abstract:
We construct artificial neural networks (ANNs) by executing
evolved programs inside two neural components: the body
(soma) and the dendrite. The programs decide whether neu-
rons and their dendrites move, change, die or replicate. When
the programs are executed they build a neural structure from
which multiple conventional ANNs can be extracted each of
which can solve a different computational problem. In bi-
ological brain development electrical activity strongly influ-
ences developmental changes. This is known as activity de-
pendence. In this paper, we describe various ways activity de-
pendence could be implemented and investigated. We show
that allowing the soma bias to be activity dependent improves
performance.
