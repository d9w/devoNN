title: "2020 Workshop on Developmental Neural Networks"
date: 2020-07-13
---

The 3rd edition of the Developmental Neural Networks Workshop will be held as a
part of [ALIFE 2020](https://2020.alife.org/). You can find all presentations
and articles below and we encourage participants to watch all videos before the
workshop or during the first section of the workshop, which will be a communal
viewing of the presentations with discussion on Slack. The second part of the
workshop will be a live discussion session in Virtual Lecture Hall B, starting
with a dedicated Q&A session for each presentation and ending with a panel
discussion on developmental neural networks.

Throughout ALIFE, please come discuss this workshop and topic in the
#workshop-DevoNN Slack channel.
