# Connectome Development – From Local Neuronal Links to Global Fibre Tract Brain Networks

Recent experimental advances allow us to study anatomical brain networks. Our
work on connectomics over the last 15 years has shown a small-world, modular,
and hub architecture of brain networks. Here, we outline potential principles
for connectome development. We will describe recent results on how spatial and
temporal factors shape connectome development and how they relate to brain
function. In particular, surprisingly simple genetic “rules” can generate
complex neural structure and function in a self-organising way. Nevertheless, to
create a deeper understanding of the relationship between the genotype and
phenotype, it is necessary to bridge the gap between different spatial and
temporal scales. Along those lines, we present the BioDynaMo software platform,
which allows to conduct highly detailed, agent-based simulations of neural
tissue development. We argue that longitudinal studies, experimentally derived
parameters for connection formation, and biologically realistic computational
models are needed to better understand the link between brain network
development, network structure, and network function.
