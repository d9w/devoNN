Abstract:
We present a framework for meta-brain models, or hybrid
models that capture multiple aspects of developmental neuro-
biology and behavior. A developmentally-inspired embodied
learning agent architecture is combined with a contextually-
explicit representational layer to form a complex artificial
nervous system. The architectural description is summarized
in terms of morphological differentiation, context-handling,
and generalized architectural features. In conclusion, we pro-
pose potential functional milestones that help further expli-
cate the usefulness of our approach.
